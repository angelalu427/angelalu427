## Hi there! I'm Angela. 
I'm a full-stack software engineer with a passion for building AI-powered systems that bridge technical innovation and human-centered design.

## Recent projects

  * Built with Python, TypeScript, OpenAI APIs, PostgreSQL, pgvector, ChromaDB, and deployed on AWS (ECS Fargate, Batch, S3, RDS, Secrets Manager)
